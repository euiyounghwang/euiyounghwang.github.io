I have ten years of experience in working with a modern search platform (Elasticsearch) and in building data pipelines & rest api services around it as a search engineer/senior software engineer. 
Especially, I am an expert in the Search Engine with a bunch of api from elasticsearch and rest_api environment using python flask, fastapi, docker â€¦ because I handled the entire version of ES from 1.7 up to 7.9 V.

Recently, I am personally implementing as test project using python, flask fastapi, and nestjs based restapi. A search engine (elasticsearch) and Postgres were used. It is also implemented based on Docker, and is being built, executed, and tested.

Recently, research has been conducted for search engine cluster monitoring and web application monitoring. In other words, we are testing to monitor search engines and restapi endpoints using prometheus and grafana.
Elasticsearch Prometheus Exporter is a builtin exporter from Elasticsearch to Prometheus. It collects all relevant metrics and makes them available to Prometheus via the Elasticsearch REST API. This is an open source project - Cluster status, Node Status such as JVM, Indices, Circuit Breaker : the feature to prevent OOM occurrence
